# Login GUI Program :octocat: Official Github Repository

This is the official repository for the console login program (with GUI) by Johnny Console.

This program is a simple login program that can store and accept up to ten (10)
user credentials. This number can be changed by changing the size of the array, in
this line: public static String[] users = new String[10]; in the Login.java file.
This is because of the way that this works: The Program.java file creates a private
variables to store the array reference so it can be used in the Program.java file.

Feel free to fork this repository to create your own commands, change the settings or
explore my code.
